    core deliverables

1. see all images in a <div id='ramen-menu'>
   upon loading request data from the server to get the array of objects that has the ramen info
   display the image for each ramen using an <img> inside the <div id='ramen-menu'>

2. create an event listener for a click event(I'd rather a mouseover) that displays the ramen info inside
   <div id="ramen-detail">. it will replace the current text

3. create a new ramen with a submit event using the new ramen form. should be added to 
   <div id="ramen-menu"> (no persist)
